PyVSB - A very simple in configuring but powerful backup tool.

PyVSB is a simple backup tool written in Python. It uses only standard file
types such as plain text and tar archives for storing backed up files which is
important because you always can easily restore particular files even if you
don't have PyVSB or it doesn't work in your environment for some reason.

PyVSB works only under Python 3. For Python 2 use PyVSB 0.2 which could be
